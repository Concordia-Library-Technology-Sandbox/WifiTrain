# WifiTrain
The train uses an Adafruit Huzzah Feather ESP32 (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah32-esp32-feather/overview) and the OpenRail designs from Depronized (https://cults3d.com/en/users/Depronized/3d-models).

We followed the Adafruit guide to get the ESP32 working in arduino. BOM and circuit diagram to follow.
